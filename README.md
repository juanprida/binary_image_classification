# Binary Image classification
Tiny little project for classification of dog vs. cats dataset.

## Details:
Scratch implementation of AlexNet model using Pytorch.

## Project structure:
Essentially, there are different python files:
- `cat_dog_dataset.py` where we define a Pytorch Dataset class.
- `alexnet.py` where we define the network architecture.
- `engine.py` where we define the engine class responsible for the actual training of the model.

All of the `.py` files can be found inside the `image_classification` folder.

## Project implementation:
To run the network, IÂ´ve been using Kaggle notebooks. An example can be found on the notebook `demo.ipynb`.
Note that in order to run it, you should add both the repo and the dataset to your Kaggle notebook.
